3D Logic Puzzle - Teaching Boolean Logic with a Game

Simple description
A small 3D puzzle game that teaches Boolean logic by having players pick up and place logic gates on pressure plates. Solve puzzles to open doors and progress through levels. More details about the design and learning goals are in the project thesis. 

Key features

Hands-on puzzles using real logic gates: AND, OR, NAND, NOR, XOR, XNOR.

Physics-based 3D movement: pick up, carry and place gates.

Immediate feedback and remediation (teleport back on wrong answer).

Eight scaffolded levels that introduce gates one-by-one.

Simple UI with input/output indicators and short tutorial popups.

How to play

Read the inputs (shown on the wall).

Pick a gate and place it on the pressure plate.

If the output matches the required value the door opens.

If not, you get teleported back - try another gate or inputs.

Tech & files

Built with Godot Engine using GDScript.
